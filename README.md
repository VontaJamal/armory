# The Armory ⚔️

Battle-tested tools and guides for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and multi-agent AI setups.

Everything here was built solving real problems in production. No theory. No tutorials. Just weapons.

> *"Every weapon has a name. Every name has a legacy."*

**Weapons:** Browse `weapons/`, pick one, follow the README. Each weapon is self-contained.

**Items:** Browse `items/`, find the guide you need, follow it step by step.

## Custom Command Word

During setup, you can name your CLI anything:

```
armory init

  What do you want your command word to be?
  > faye

  Done. "faye masamune", "faye scan" are now live.
```

Same weapons, your identity.
