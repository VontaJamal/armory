# The Armory ⚔️

Battle-tested tools and guides for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and multi-agent AI setups.

Everything here was built solving real problems in production. No theory. No tutorials. Just weapons.

> *"Every weapon has a name. Every name has a legacy."*

## How to Use

**Weapons:** Browse `weapons/`, pick one, follow the README. Copy the script, run the installer, done.

**Spells:** Browse `spells/`, copy the cron config into your OpenClaw setup. They cast themselves from there.

**Items:** Browse `items/`, find the guide, follow it. Most problems are solved in under 5 minutes with these.

## Custom Command Word

During setup, name your CLI anything you want:

```
armory init

  What's your command word?
  > shadow

  Done. "shadow masamune", "shadow scan" are now live.
```

Same weapons. Your identity.
