# The Armory ⚔️

Battle-tested snippets, cheat sheets, and workflow patterns for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and multi-agent AI setups.

Everything here was built solving real problems in production. No theory. No tutorials. Just weapons.

## What's Inside

| Folder | What You'll Find |
|--------|-----------------|
| `openclaw/` | Configuration tips, cron scheduling, gateway debugging, Telegram setup |
| `agents/` | Multi-agent communication, heartbeat patterns, sub-agent orchestration |
| `windows/` | NSSM services, PowerShell automation, SSH from non-elevated shells |
| `scripts/` | Ready-to-use scripts for backups, health checks, workspace sync |

## How to Use

Browse the folders. Find what you need. Copy it. Most files are self-contained with clear instructions at the top.
