# Armory Shop

This repository is the shopfront. Every useful FF-themed tool can live here.

Use this file as the catalog overview, and use [`catalog.json`](catalog.json) as the machine-readable source.

## How To Add Something

1. If you have a script now, follow full-tool flow in [`ADD-TO-SHOP.md`](ADD-TO-SHOP.md).
2. If you only have an idea, add an idea entry now so others can build it later.

## Current Idea Shelf

## Mognet (Idea)

- Plain description: Unified notification relay for tool outputs, with channel routing, retries, and digest formatting.
